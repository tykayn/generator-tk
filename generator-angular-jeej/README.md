# generator-angular-jeej
status: not working by now.

## Getting Started
you need yeoman from NPM. To install it in command line, run this:
```sh
$ npm i -g yo
```
to run the generator, use yo.
```sh
$ yo angular-jeej
```
You will be asked a name for your webapp.
After all is set up, enjoy your new app.
You just have to run the default gulp task to have your webapp live.
Each time you will save a scss, coffee, or html, they will be compiled, concatened and rendered into the dist folder.

```sh
$ gulp
```
if you did no error in these watched files, you will be able to reach your webapp on localhost.
http://localhost:3002/
